# Face emotions recognition

This project was developed in the context of [Machine Learning Topics](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12832) curricular unit, part of the Computer Science Bachelor at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/). It was lectured by [Pétia Georgieva Georgieva](https://www.ua.pt/en/p/10321408).



## About the project

Analysing facial expressions is often used in emotion recognition. The aim of this project is to analyse the performance of different machine learning models, that classify emotions through facial images taken in the wild. For this purpose 8400 images were used from a public dataset. Using Jupyter notebooks, two different machine learning algorithms were tested, support vector machine and neural networks. The best model achieved an accuracy of 38,8% classifying 6 different emotions.



## Technology stack

The code for this project was developed in Python, with the libraries [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for NN and SVM.
